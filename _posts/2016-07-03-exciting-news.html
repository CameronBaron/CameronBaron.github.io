I thought I would give this its own post as I am that excited about it.
</p>

For school, our end of year project is to work in groups to make a game over the next 6 months which is pretty exciting. So far the longest we have had to make a project is just under 3 months, and that was when our group made Genepool (not to brag but it's pretty damn good :P). About a month ago our teachers mentioned that there were some internships coming up that would take place of our end of year project. The first to be brought up was with FMOD, their office is 5 floors above our school in the Melbourne World Trade Centre, after having used their low level library in a recent project (<a href="/game_dev/2016/05/07/game-sound-system">Game Sound System </a>) I was super excited about this opportunity.

I had under a week to play around with FMOD's unity plugin and demo before I needed to submit an application. All I knew wasthat they wanted a demo that they could have available on their website to give to people/companies wanting to use their plugin and more in their own applications. So I took the current demo, Rollaball, changed it a bit, added some more examples and came up with <a href="https://github.com/CameronBaron/FMOD_Unity_Plugin_testing"> this. </a> Not the most beautiful scenery but it shows off some 3D sound effects (and I'm no artist :P).

Last week I found out that I had been selected for the internship!!! Along with 3 others, 1 artist, 1 designer and 1 other programmer. We had a meeting later that week with the CEO of FMOD about some ideas and what is expected. We will be working in their office for the next 5 months 3 days a week. Hopefully this will be as good for my career as I think it will be, specialising in audio for 5 months and working hand in hand with FMOD should look pretty good on the ol' resume. Not to mention having an application that gets viewed and used all over the world by other developers wanting to learn how to use FMOD in their own projects! (#hype)
