<p>
It has been a little while since my last post so I will split this one up into two as quite a bit has happened. I will start with my last school assessment, Physics.
</p>

<p>
The task we were given, was to show and implement a number of demonstrations:
<ul>
	<li>Physics</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Multiple objects interacting with each other</li>
		<li>Appropriate use of Newtons 3rd law of motion</li>
		<li>Collisions and applied forces</li>
		<li>An example of spring physics</li>
	</ul>
	<li>PhysX</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Static and rigid body interaction</li>
		<li>Ragdoll physics</li>
		<li>1 Player controlled object</li>
		<li>Trigger volume that interacts with dynamic scene elements</li>
		<li>Particle based fluid or soft body simulation</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
</p>
