The beginning of the year has just flown by already. Our first assessment for school this year, was to create our own basic game engine using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL" target="_blank">OpenGL</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLFW" target="_blank">GLFW</a> (along with a few other more specialized libraries too). This was a lot of fun and also very interesting, because we were learning all the workings that go on deep down behind the scenes.
<ul>
	<li>Rendering basic geometry (everything is broken down to triangles)</li>
	<li>Texturing models</li>
	<li>Animations</li>
	<li>Lighting (Direction/Spot/Point)</li>
	<li>Particle Systems (Both CPU and GPU based)</li>
	<li>GUI (Graphical User Interface)</li>
	<li>Procedural Generation</li>
	<li>Frustum Culling</li>
	<li>Render Targets (eg. reflections seen in mirrors)</li>
	<li>and more</li>
</ul>
</p>

I was really impressed at the difference between the two Particle Systems we made. The CPU based system couldn't handle more than a couple thousand separate particles without struggling. Whereas the GPU based system didn't break a sweat until we got into the millions of particles (see below, using around 50,000 particles).

Learning all these topics while trying to build something useful of our own was a challenge. Although just like anything new or foreign, it can seem daunting to begin with. Once I got my head around the general concepts and understood how everything fits together, it all seemed to all fall into place.
