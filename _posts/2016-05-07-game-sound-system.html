Over the past month and a bit, I have been working on a game system to show off some game audio features. At first, I wasn't sure what I could do or how to even do it, but I definitely aimed big. Although I didn't end up where I originally wanted to at the end of the project, I am very happy with the result I came up with, and plan to continue on so that I can meet my initial goals. Below is a picture of the visualisation I am using.

I did have one issue one day where I all of a sudden lost some functionality, the sound would go from left to right speaker but once the sound was behind you it could not be heard. It was so weird as it had been working the previous day, I spent the next two days going back through my code to see what could have possibly changed. Eventually I thought, did I change something in the Windows Audio Manager tool? ...TWO DAYS...two bloody days just to realise that I had set the speaker config to 4 speakers rather than two. At least it wasn't something in my program :P That was fun...

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMOD" target="_blank">FMOD's</a> low level API library has been fun to work with, while it was tough at times, it was even more fun when things where working properly. There are still many parts of FMOD I didn't even touch, but I do look forward to playing around with it more in the future.

I have even uploaded a couple of videos showing it off to YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/twitchin86/videos?sort=dd&amp;view=0&amp;shelf_id=0" target="_blank">check out my channel</a>.

We have already started our next assignment which is making a Physics Engine and separately using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhysX" target="_blank">PhysX</a> to create some cool effects. I have already made my own Rocket Ship (you just need to use some imagination until next time). I am hoping to add this project to my audio program to do some cool stuff with both the physics and audio.
