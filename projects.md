### [FMOD Unity Demo](https://github.com/CameronBaron/AIE-FMOD-Student-Project) 
FMOD Unity Integration Demo created as part of a group internship at FMOD in Melbourne, made up of 1 artist, 1 designer and 2 programmers, which was also used as our final assessment project. 
FMOD is an audio middleware company with their main tool, FMOD Studio, aimed at Sound Engineers/Designers. This tool can integrate with Unity and Unreal Engine to futher enhance your games sound.
The target audience of the demo is any developer that hasn't used FMOD with Unity before. With a large focus on teaching basic techniques and ideas, we too learnt a lot about using the FMOD Unity Integration.

Our concept was to break down a number of key basics, seperatly as to not distract the user, display an example of its implementation and try to explain what is happening.
So we designed individual rooms (Unity scenes) as a way of seperating the topics, not only with demo/gameplay in mind, for developers working in the Unity Editor to better navigate.

As you enter the scene you are greeted by the control display screen, once the mouse button is pressed, an elevator takes you up to the main hub (the Overworld).
From this multi-leveled scene, you can access any room either by walking to it or by teleporting from the Pause Menu.

I would highly encourage anyone that has not used audio middleware with Unity to give it a go, it is quite easy to setup and can turn a good game into an amazing experience.

### [Audio Visual Demo](https://github.com/CameronBaron/SoundProgramming)
Visual Studio C++ OpenGL GameEngine with FMOD Low Level API made for a school assignment, 2016.
This project was a lot of fun! As it was my first time playing with audio every step felt like a great accomplishment.
I also used this as part of my application for an internship at FMOD (that I got!).

In this demo are 5 open-face boxes (rooms) that each contain their own sound and data.
Using FMOD's built in geometry system, it was fairly easy to setup custom occlusion on the room walls by using the same data that the graphics used to draw it.
This added some realism to project and gave the occlusion objects some 'weight' in the world.

Another cool feature I added was a dynamic audio visualiser on the back face of each of the 'rooms', using the FFT data live from each of the playing songs.

### [Physics & PhysX](https://github.com/CameronBaron/PhysicsEngine)
C++ physics engine made using Nvidia PhysX and Custom Physics seperatly.

This project shows some of the differences between the two physics engines, while PhysX may seem like the best option as it can already do pretty much everything for you, if you only require a small light-weight physics engine you may be better off making your own.

### [Genepool](https://github.com/CameronBaron/GenepoolGame)
At the end of 2015, a group of 6 people (2 programmers, 2 artists, 2 designers) were given 3 months to make a game of our choice. 
We decided to make a local multiplayer, top-down, twin-stick shooter and I am very impressed with how it turned out.

The final project ended up having one game option, free-for-all, that pit you against up to 3 other players (and some annoying AI) to score the most kills in the time limit. Each player has 4 weapons they can switch between at any time, assault rifle, shotgun, flamethrower and rocket launcher. Some are a little more over-powered than others.
