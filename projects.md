FMOD Unity Integration Demo

### [Audio Visual Demo](https://github.com/CameronBaron/SoundProgramming)
Visual Studio C++ OpenGL GameEngine with FMOD Low Level API made for a school assignment, 2016.
This project was a lot of fun! As it was my first time playing with audio every step felt like a great accomplishment.
I also used this as part of my application for an internship at FMOD (that I got!).

C++ physics engine made using Nvidia PhysX and Custom Physics seperatly.

### [Genepool](https://github.com/CameronBaron/GenepoolGame)
At the end of 2015, a group of 6 people (2 programmers, 2 artists, 2 designers) were given 3 months to make a game of our choice. 
We decided to make a local multiplayer, twin-stick shooter and I am very impressed with how it turned out.
