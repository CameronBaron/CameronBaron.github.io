As you may have noticed around this site, my name is Cameron Baron from Melbourne Australia and I am currently studying an Advanced Diploma in Programming at [AIE.](http://aie.edu.au)
Previously I was working as an Automotive Spare Parts Interpreter (the official title is even longer!) and Sales Representative. I started out with cars in North Queensland a number of years ago
and worked my way south to Melbourne while migrating into the commercial truck industry. Spare Parts has taught me many invaluable life skills: conflict resolution, workplace communication, 
group/indivdual managment and customer relations.

After finishing high school, I never really thought of programming as a career, mainly due to the fact that there were close to no opportunities in North Queensland. Since moving to Melbourne 
I have completed the Cert 2 Programming course at AIE (basically an intro to this diploma course) and fell in love with it. The last time I touched any code was in high school using delphi, seems like so long ago now.

As you can probably tell, this is my first attempt at any kind of website. As my knowledge and skills grow, so too will this, the hub for information on your favourite Cameron!
Any and all feedback/criticism welcome (hopefully positive).
