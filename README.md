This is a modest attempt at making my own website, mainly to host my own portfolio, and my first play with HTML & CSS.

I chose to use Jekyll on github pages as it sounded like a great way to setup a static site with a lot of customization.

Using the theme <a href="https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono">Jekyll-Mono</a> as a base, I have been learning as I progress to making this something I can be proud of.
